		<h2>The Problem</h2>
		<p>PROTECT3D makes customized orthotics that, in addition to greatly speeding up recovery, also are made to specifically fit the patient’s foot to minimize the impact on their life while recovering. They do this by taking a 3D scan of the patient’s foot with their own app, using the technology found on the front facing camera of iPhones and iPads. This is significantly faster than traditional molding methods such as casting.</p>
		<p>As they transition from using this mostly on athletes to general clinical settings and even the operating room, the importance of getting a fast, accurate, scan consistently becomes even more important, since doctors have a lot less time to get an accurate time. This fall, our team is working to build a system that reduces the time it takes for medical personnel to learn to take accurate scans consistently and in a timely manner.</p>

		<h2>Two Designs</h2>
		<p>We came down to 2 designs, one from our pugh scoring matrix and one proposed by our client.</p>

		<h2>Intial Cart and rail</h2>
		<p>I led the efforts on designing a cart and rail for the project. The first cart that was fully CADed and prototyped was a flat board with 3 holes where bearings would be screwed on. To make the rail, a 1.75 inch ring was laser cut and a slit was put in with the idea that multiple of these would be attached together to create the screw. The phone would be screwed on at a later point. See images for visuals. </p>

		<h2>Problems with the intial cart and rail</h2>
		<p>Supporting the screw shape and the weight of the cart proved to be big problems moving forward and with our limited time, we agreed to pivot back and use the other design - a ring that can move back and forth, not a screw.</p>
	</section>
	<section class = "newDesign">
		<h2>Current cart and rail</h2>
		<p>The current version has simplified the cart significantly and gotten rid of the bearings. Instead, a guide that follows the track and another clamp to help the guide stay on the track is being used. This cuts down on weight and the ring being simplier than a screw makes that part easier as well. To construct the rail, a jig is being laser cut and an arcrylic rectangle of 8mm thickness is being screwed onto it as a rail. The jig is cut in 40 degree chunks out of a ring with inner diameter 34 inches and outer diameter 36 inchs and as the jig is made up of 3 laser cut pieces glued together, the middle one is offset from the others so assembly is easy. Below as some images of the new ring and guide.</p>
